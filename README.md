From YouTube, to books I purchase online about coding I plan on making different branches for each language in this repo showing the tools/ lessons I have learned. It also makes for a great reference point for when I start making larger projects.

|  lang   |  status  |
|---------|----------|
|  cpp    | learning |
|  cli    |          |
|  py     |          |
|  html   |          |
|  css    |          |
|  js     |          |
|  go     |          |
|  sql    |          |
|  node   |          |
|  git    |          |
|  bash   |          |
|  regex  |          |
|  react  |          |
|  docker |          |
|  ghcli  |          |
